# Internet Engineering Course Webpsite
Fall 2022

## Introduction

As part of my role as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the Internet Engineering course, I undertook the task of designing a front-end assignment that focuses on the fundamental concepts of web development. The objective of this project was to provide students with an engaging hands-on experience while fostering their understanding of HTML, CSS, and SCSS.

The project entailed creating a simple yet functional website using these core technologies. By utilizing HTML, students were able to structure the website's content effectively, while CSS allowed them to craft visually appealing designs. To further enhance the styling process, the project introduced SCSSâ€”a powerful extension of CSS that empowers students to write clean and maintainable code through the utilization of variables, mixins, and nesting.

Throughout the development process, students gained proficiency in crafting well-structured HTML elements, implementing CSS styles, and employing SCSS to streamline their design workflow. Responsive design principles were also covered, ensuring that the websites created were adaptable and optimized for diverse devices and screen sizes.
